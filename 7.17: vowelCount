Write a static method named vowelCount that accepts a String as a parameter and returns an 
array of integers representing the counts of each vowel in the String. The array returned 
by your method should hold 5 elements: the first is the count of As, the second is the count of 
Es, the third Is, the fourth Os, and the fifth Us. Assume that the string contains no uppercase letters.

For example, the call vowelCount("i think, therefore i am") should return the array {1, 3, 3, 1, 0}.

public static int[] vowelCount(String str){
    int[] counts = new int[5]; 
    
    for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++){
        char curr = str.charAt(i); 
        if(curr == 'a'){
            counts[0]++;
        }
        if(curr == 'e'){
            counts[1]++;
        } 
        if(curr == 'i'){
            counts[2]++;
        }
        if(curr == 'o'){
            counts[3]++;
        }
        if(curr == 'u'){
            counts[4]++; 
        }
    }
    
    return counts;
}
