Write a method called median that accepts an array of integers as its argument 
and returns the median of the numbers in the array. The median is the number that 
will appear in the middle if you arrange the elements in order. Assume that the array 
is of odd size (so that one sole element constitutes the median) and that the numbers in 
the array are between 0 and 99 inclusive.

For example, the median of {5, 2, 4, 17, 55, 4, 3, 26, 18, 2, 17} is 5, and the median 
of {42, 37, 1, 97, 1, 2, 7, 42, 3, 25, 89, 15, 10, 29, 27} is 25.

public static int median(int[] arr){
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++){
        for(int j = i+1; j<arr.length; j++){
            if(arr[j] < arr[i]){
                int temp = arr[i]; 
                arr[i] = arr[j]; 
                arr[j] = temp; 
            }
        }
    }
    
    return arr[arr.length/2];
    
}
